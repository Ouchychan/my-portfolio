      <p className="text-black-800">
        I’m a fresh graduate software engineer with a strong passion for UI/UX
        and full stack web development. My main focus is on designing and
        building clean, accessible, and engaging websites or applications that
        help people bring their ideas to life. Whether it’s front-end visuals or
        back-end logic, I enjoy turning concepts into real, working products—and
        I’m always eager to learn, collaborate, and grow in the process.
